# Level 3 Task 3 -Sorting & Searching

## Task 1

● Design a class called Album. The class should contain:

○ The data fields albumName (String), numberOfSongs (int) and albumArtist (String).

○ A constructor that constructs a Album object with the specified albumName, numberOfSongs, and albumArtist.

○ The relevant get and set methods for the data fields.

○ A toString() method that returns a string that represents an Album object in the following format:

(albumName, albumArtist, numberOfSongs)

● Create a new ArrayList called albums1, add 5 albums to it and print it out (You may want to look back to the Java Collections Framework task for guidance).

● Sort the list according to the numberOfSongs and print it out.

● Swap the element at position 1 of albums1 with the element at position 2 and print it out.

● Create a new ArrayList called albums2.

● Using the addAll method add 5 albums to the albums2 List and print it out.

● Copy all of the albums from albums1 into albums2.

● Add the following two elements to albums2:

○ (Dark Side of the Moon, Pink Floyd, 9)

○ (Oops!... I Did It Again, Britney Spears, 16)

● Sort the courses in albums2 alphabetically according to the album name and print it out.

● Search for the album “Dark Side of the Moon” in albums2 and print out the index of the album in the List.

## Task 2

Using the following ArrayList: [“blue”, “six”, “hello”, “game”, “unorthodox”, “referee”, “ask”, “zebra”, “run”, “flex”]

○ Create a Java file called BubbleSort.java

○ Implement the Bubble sort algorithm on the ArrayList and print out the sorted list.

## Task 3

Using the following array: [27, -3, 4, 5, 35, 2, 1, -40, 7, 18, 9, -1, 16, 100]

○ Create a Java file called Sort&Search.java

Which searching algorithm would be appropriate to use on the given list?

○ Implement this searching algorithm to search for the number 9. Add a comment to explain why you think this algorithm was a good choice.

○ Research and implement the Insertion sort on this array.

○ Implement the searching algorithm you haven’t tried yet in this Task on the sorted array to find the number 9. Add a comment to explain where you would use this algorithm in the real world.
